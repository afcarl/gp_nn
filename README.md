Setting up environment:

Coregion-py3 (main notebook) works with GPFlow v 1.0.0 and Python 3. If you create a new conda environment and install:
-Tensorflow version 1.0   
-pandas, numpy, matplotlib, jupyter   
-GPFlow version 1.0 ("pip install ." in main directory)   

The notebook should work with no problem. 

This is all currently done on gpflowenv environment, which can be activted via:
source activate gpflowenv
